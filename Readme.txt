This program has two components: builder and stub. The builder obfuscates a desired program/file by encrypting it, and then attaches the resulting file to the "stub".

The stub, upon running, reads the attached part, decrypts back into its original form, saves it into desired location onto the disk and then invokes it.

Do Not Run "stub" alone, it won't work.

Whatever MS .Net Framework that comes with VB.Net 2008 or later is required to run the program.
