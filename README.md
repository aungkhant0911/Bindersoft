# About

A multi-files combiner application written in VB.Net a while ago. Been in a situation where I wished I could treat as many programs or files of any type as a single one. Not only that but this program also allows one to keep files encrypted, granting portability and not have to worry about the threat of antivirus software.



# Requirements

.Net Runtime 3.5
Visual Basic.Net 2008 or later is required to edit source.



# How it works?
  - Builder is used to bind files. The following diagram provides the user interaction and what it takes to get a single executable file, called Stub.

  - Once the Stub has been created, it can then be executed, upon which one can get back all the original files.
